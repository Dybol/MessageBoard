# MessageBoard
An internet forum, that allows people to talk to each other on various topics. </br>
It is mostly built on **Spring Boot** and **Thymeleaf**. I also use **MDB** to make the website look better. </br> </br>
Some features that the website contains:
- Newsletter - Any user can add his email to the newsletter database, and an administrator can send each one of them a message from admin's panel. 
- Registration tokens - You have to confirm your email given in the registration process in order to complete it and activate your account. To do that, you need to click the link that is sent to your email.
- Reseting password - You can reset your password anytime you want - you just need to pass your email address and the reseting link will be sent on it.
- Roles - Only logged in users can add posts / responses or write messages on the chat. Also, only an admin sees an option to go to the admin panel and is permitted to do the magic there.
